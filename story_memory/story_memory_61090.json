    "You wake up in a misty forest. The air is heavy with fog. In the distance, a flickering lantern glows faintly.",
    "try to reach the lanterns: You begin to stumble through the dense mist, the ground uneven beneath your feet as unseen roots and rocks snag at your boots. The air grows colder with each step, yet the distant lantern, a beacon of wavering warmth, seems to pull you forward. The sound of your own hurried breathing is the only thing breaking the profound silence, until a faint, rustling whisper seems to drift from the trees, almost too soft to discern.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Call out towards the source of the whisper.\nB. Ignore the whisper and press on towards the lantern.",
    "go to the lantern and pick it up and look around the surroundings: Ignoring the faint, rustling whisper, you press on, your hands finally closing around the cold, iron frame of the lantern hanging from a gnarled, low-slung branch. Its feeble, wavering flame offers little warmth but casts a fragile circle of light, momentarily pushing back the oppressive mist. As you unhook it and lift it, its small glow reveals only the immediate tangle of roots and the ghostly, indistinct outlines of trees, the source of the whisper still hidden in the gloom beyond.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Direct the lantern's light towards where you heard the whisper.\nB. Choose a direction and begin walking, using the lantern to light your way.",
    "a: You swing the lantern, its feeble beam struggling to pierce the dense fog. For a fleeting instant, a dark, elongated shadow seems to writhe among the tree trunks, just beyond the reach of the light, before the swirling mist swallows it whole. The whisper has ceased, leaving behind an even deeper, more profound silence. The only sound now is the faint hiss of the lantern's flame.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Call out into the mist, asking who or what is there.\nB. Turn and walk in a random direction, using the lantern to light your path forward.",
    "a: \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" your voice echoes, thin and vulnerable, swallowed almost instantly by the oppressive mist. Only the faint hiss of the lantern replies, the silence pressing in around you, heavy and unbroken. A shiver traces its way down your spine, a cold sensation unrelated to the chilly air, as if unseen eyes are now fixed upon your fragile light. The shadow remains hidden, yet its presence feels closer, more palpable, lurking just beyond the edge of your limited vision.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Cautiously step in the direction where you saw the shadow, holding the lantern high.\nB. Choose a new, arbitrary direction and begin walking, seeking anything beyond the immediate trees.",
    "step in the direction where you saw the shadow and figure out who is there: You cautiously step in the direction where the shadow had writhed, the lantern's light carving a meager tunnel through the unrelenting mist. Each hesitant stride brings only more gnarled roots and indistinct tree trunks, the ground soft and damp beneath your boots. You find no trace of the elongated form, no disturbed leaves, only an unwavering, profound silence that feels less like an absence of sound and more like a held breath. The chilling certainty that you are not alone, however, lingers like the cold, damp air.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Circle the immediate area, sweeping the lantern for any hidden details or paths.\nB. Turn and walk in a new, distinct direction, hoping to escape the oppressive feeling.",
    "you suddenly feel a cold wisp behind you, you turn around and see an hot elf standing there staring at you with dispise: The chilling certainty that you were not alone proved true as a cold wisp brushed your neck. Before you could fully turn, a figure materialized from the mist directly behind you. Standing tall, an elf with piercing, icy eyes and sharp, elegant features glared down at you, their expression etched with undisguised disdain. The air around them crackled with an unseen tension, making the lantern's flame flicker wildly in your trembling hand.\n\nWhat do you do?\nA. Demand to know who they are and why they are staring at you.\nB. Slowly raise the lantern, hoping to use its light as a deterrent or shield."
